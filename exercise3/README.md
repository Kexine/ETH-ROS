## Exercise 3
The goal of this exercise was to close the control loop for the Husky robot. I extracted the
position of a pillar from the laser scan and then controled the robot such that it drove into the
pillar.

## Notes
- Husky drives to the pillar 10 seconds after launch
- Husky does not hit the pillar, beacuse I stop it at 1 distance unit before the pillar
- Turn on TF, Robot Model and Laser Scan visualization in RViz
